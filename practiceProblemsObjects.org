Start by creating a new object, invoices. The object requires a property named unpaid; unpaid should be an array that is initially empty.

Write a method named add for the invoices object. This method
should take two arguments: a string for the client name and a
number for the amount they owe. The method should create a new
object with these two arguments as properties, then push it onto
the unpaid array. The object should look like { name:
"Starbucks", amount: 300 }. Be sure to use the this keyword to
reference the unpaid array in your method.
  const invoices = {
    unpaid: [],
    add: function (clientName, amountOwed) {
      this.unpaid.push({ name: clientName, amount: amountOwed })
    },
  }
